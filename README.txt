The following report was generated through a provided guideline.

Part 1 consists of Data Collection and Exploration with questions on the exploratory Data Analysis.
Visual data was used to support arguments of EDA in order to specify the rationale behind. 
Visual data for Part 1 includes correlation plots, and pairwise plots across variables to show functional relationships.

Part 2 is dedicated towards preparing the data. Based on Part 1, we made decisions to split data for part 2 based on coordinates of x and y.
Using visual data that shows correlation across all features in the dataset, we decided to use 3 features, NDAI, AF, and AN.

Part 3 uses different classification algorithms with comparison across validation accuracies. We used logistic regression, LDA, QDA, and KNN (n = 8).
The left data corresponds to the data that was split by X coordinates and the right data corresponds to the data split by Y coordinates with the inclusion of ROC curves that show how to balance false positives and true positives.

Part 4 observes in detail about the accuracy of KNN in our case because KNN gave the best validation scores. As a result, we made observations and potential suggestions for improving our accuracy by improving our data.  The visual data is shown to show potential commonalities across errors.

After that, we added acknowledgements and the github link that will include this and other code used for this project.
